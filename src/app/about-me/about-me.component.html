     <div data-aos="fade-right">
            <p class="margin-top-30">Hi, I'm Bj√∂rn Daigger, junior frontend developer from Mannheim, Germany. I create
                user experiences and bring designs to life with clean and efficient code.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-top-30"> My professional journey started as a professional musician, where I was usually
                responsible for website creation, the online store and social media management. I have always been
                fascinated by the rapid developments in the digital world, so it was a logical step for me to pursue
                further education as a frontend developer to expand my skills.</p>

            <p>I develop processes that help to optimize your processes. In doing so, I greatly enjoy working with a
                team on projects and collectively finding solutions to challenges.</p>

            <p>Now that I've completed my advanced training, I'm looking forward to starting a new career as a junior
                frontend developer.</p>
