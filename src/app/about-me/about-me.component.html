        <div data-aos="fade-right">
            <p class="margin-top-30">Hi, I'm Björn Daigger, a junior frontend developer from Mannheim, Germany. I
                create user experiences and bring designs to life with clean and efficient code.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-top-30">My professional journey started as a professional musician. Besides my artistic
                work, creating websites, online stores and managing social media was part of my everyday life in the
                music business. The rapid developments in the digital world have always fascinated me. So, it was a
                natural step for me to undergo further training as a Frontend Developer at the Developer Akademie in
                Munich to expand my skills in this field.
            </p>

            <p>I am passionate about creating great user experiences, designing beautiful interfaces and user interfaces
                and writing maintainable, structured and best-practice oriented code. I am constantly trying to improve
                my skills and learn new technologies.</p>

            <p>Now that I've completed my advanced training, I'm looking forward to starting a new career as a junior
                frontend developer.</p>
